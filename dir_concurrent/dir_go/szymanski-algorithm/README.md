# Szymanski's Algorithm for Mutual Exclusion

This directory contains a Go implementation of Szymanski's algorithm for mutual exclusion.

## Description

The program simulates multiple processes competing for a critical section using Szymanski's algorithm. The state of each process and the shared flags are displayed to visualize the algorithm's execution.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, use the `go run` command in this directory:

```bash
go run .
```

The program will run for a fixed duration and then exit, reporting whether all processes completed successfully.
