# ON - Lab 2: Numerical Stability and Function Analysis

This directory contains Julia and Python scripts for the second lab of the "Numerical Calculations" course. The lab focuses on analyzing numerical errors and the behavior of functions.

## Scripts and Problems

### `z1.jl`: Dot Product Stability

This script analyzes the effect of small changes in input data on the result of a dot product calculation. It implements several variations of the dot product algorithm (e.g., forward summation, backward summation, sorted summation) to demonstrate how the order of operations can affect the result's accuracy due to floating-point errors.

### `z2.jl` and `z2.py`: Function Analysis and Numerical Instability

These scripts (`z2.jl` in Julia and `z2.py` in Python) analyze the function `f(x) = e^x * ln(1 + e^(-x))`. They demonstrate a common numerical stability problem where the direct computation of the function leads to a loss of significant digits for large values of `x`.

The scripts perform the following actions:
*   Calculate the theoretical limit of the function.
*   Show how the standard `Float64` precision fails for large `x`.
*   Generate plots to visualize the function's behavior and the numerical error.
*   The `.png` files in this directory are the plots generated by these scripts.

### Other Scripts (`z3.jl` - `z6.jl`)

These Julia scripts are solutions to the other problems in the second lab, likely covering other topics in numerical analysis.

## How to Run

### Julia Scripts (`.jl`)

To run the Julia scripts, you will need to have the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/downloads/) installed. The scripts may also require external packages (like `Plots.jl`), which they will attempt to install automatically if missing.

Execute a script from your terminal using the `julia` command:
```bash
julia <script_name.jl>
```
**Example:**
```bash
julia z1.jl
julia z2.jl
```

### Python Script (`.py`)

To run the Python script, you will need Python 3 and the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. The presence of a `.venv` directory suggests using a virtual environment is good practice.

1.  **Set up the environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python3 z2.py
    ```
